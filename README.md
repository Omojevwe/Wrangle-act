# Wrangle-act
My second project on Udacity
The data I used is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs, which is a twitter account that rate peopleâ€™s dogs with a humorous content about the dogs.
The main purpose of this project is to wrangle (gather, assess and clean) the given datasets. They are three different datasets given that I gathered, cleaned, merged together then analyzed.
